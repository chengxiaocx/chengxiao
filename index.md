## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Linguistics Program](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/linguistics/index.php) at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu). My research lies at the intersection of second language acquisition and cognitive neuroscience, with a focus on the processing of semantics and emotional prosody. I am co-advised by Drs. [Jiang Liu](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/our_people/liu_jiang.php) and [Rutvik Desai](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/our_people/directory/desai_rutvik.php). I am currently a graduate research assistant in the [Desai Lab](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/research_clinical_facilities/labs/desai_lab/index.php/).

My dissertation investigates how native and non-native speakers perceive emotional prosody in a tonal language—Mandarin Chinese, and examines how semantics influence the emotional prosody processing of L1 and L2 Chinese speakers. I also utilize [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) to explore whether native speakers and L2 learners use similar brain mechanisms to process semantics and emotional prosody in Mandarin Chinese words and sentences.
